Code for eye center localization

1. Run the "Run_database.m" to get the performance evaluation on the BioID database and Gi4e database.
2. Run the "Run_Live_camera.m" to get see the performance of this algorithm in practical with a web camera.
3. Some localization results and video results are also included in this folder.

Note: This code utilized the SDM[1] for face alignment, please get the code from the corresponding authors or use another face alignment method to feed this function.
